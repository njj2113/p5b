## Executive Summary:

The HWPlanner applet is meant to allow students to casually organize their list of homework online. It does so by implementing a more task-specific google-docs of sorts.

This tool is meant to be able to help you organize your HW (or a general todo list) using Riot to organize the display of the related concepts HWPlanner, its included assignments, and their included subgoals. Course and assignment information is saved to/via an online database: Google's Firestore. Finally, p5 is used to display and allow more satisfying management of different assignments. Specifically, new assignments are automatically added as bouncing circles and can be deleted from the screen (and the corresponding database) by clicking on a given assignment circle.
